# JMP-Tools

## Version 0.3.1 is up!

A tool designed to allow having better control of the workers' score during their day at the work. For JMP warehouse workers.

The app is mainly going to be focused at the truck loaders section, but it also might be embracing the packaging section in the future.

The main goal is to make the app working on portable devices such as smartphones, or any other devices that use Android operation system.

As a very beginner in programming, I'll try to create the app using React.
